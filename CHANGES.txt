1.2.2 (2011-05-30)
------------------

- Fixed ``OSError`` in formatter which could occur when a test case modifies
  the current working directory to a directory that gets removed during the
  test. In such cases we fall back to the working directory as it was in the
  beginning of the tests.
  [dokai]


1.2.1 (2011-02-03)
------------------

- Fixed ``IndexError`` in formatter which could occur when the path of the
  current working directory was part of the path + file name of the doctest
  file but shorter.


1.2 (2011-01-27)
----------------

- Added support for Manuel_ tests. It gets activated when the package under
  test has tests using `manuel` and this way depends on `manuel`.
  [icemac]

1.1 (2011-01-20)
----------------

  [hannosch]

  [hannosch]

  missing dependency on `zc.recipe.egg`.
  [multani]

1.0b3 (2010-06-07)

  uses the ``-x`` option for something else. :-(

------------------

* Maintain compatibility with zope.testing 3.7.

1.0b1 (2009-11-07)
